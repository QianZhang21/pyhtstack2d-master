Project: 2D BN/Metal/BN Heterostructure Construction and Analysis
==============================================================

Description:
------------
This project provides tools and data for constructing, stacking, and analyzing
2D metal/BN heterostructures using structures obtained from the Materials Project (MP) database.

Folders:
--------

1. MP/
   - Contains 3D metal structures that were screened from the Materials Project database
     based on specific selection criteria.

2. 3D_POSCAR_dir/
   - Contains optimized 3D metal structures after structural relaxation.

3. Results/
   - Contains calculation outputs for the heterostructures.
   - NOTE: The file 'In-mp85.vasp' was accidentally deleted before calculation.
     As a result, the In-core heterostructure is not included in the current results.

Scripts:
--------

1. cleavesurface.py
   - Used to cleave 2D metal layers from 3D metal bulk structures.

2. mismatch.py
   - Stacks 2D metal layers with BN layers to form sandwich heterostructures.
   - Designed for hexagonal lattice systems.

3. mismatch_square.py
   - Similar to mismatch.py but intended for orthorhombic, tetragonal, or cubic systems.

4. isPuckered.py
   - Calculates the degree of puckering (out-of-plane distortion) in the BN layers
     after structure optimization.
